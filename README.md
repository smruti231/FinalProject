Features:

2.	Hotel Booking: Users interested in booking a hotel can select their preferred option from the list, view detailed information, and click the "Book" button. This action triggers an automated email notification to the chosen hotel, informing them of the user's interest and contact details. Simultaneously, the user receives an acknowledgment email, ensuring a seamless booking experience.
3.	Cab Booking: When users require transportation within the city, they can use the integrated Cab Booking feature. The platform utilizes the Google Maps API to calculate fare estimates for trips between specified source and destination points, ensuring transparency and convenience for users.

These blogs offer valuable insights, tips, and personal anecdotes about various destinations. The community can interact through comments and ratings, fostering a sense of connection among travelers.
